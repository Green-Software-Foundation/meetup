# Meetup

The GSF Meetup program facilitates the growth of the global community of green software practitioners. 
We cover for the costs of running a meetup on meetup.com and provide meetup organizations with support in the form of assets, materials, sourcing speakers, project management, anything to help reduce the burden of running a local user group and help the local meetup run successful events.
This is a project run through the Community Working Group in the [Green Software Foundation](https://greensoftware.foundation) and can be viewed through https://www.meetup.com/pro/gsf/
