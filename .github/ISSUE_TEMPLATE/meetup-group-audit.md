Issue used for regular review of all meetup groups. This is to ensure all groups have at least one active organiser and an event plan. If not it provides an action plan to provide future guidance on the status of the group. Data to be sourced by GSF Staff from [Meetup Pro](https://www.meetup.com/pro/gsf/admin/chapters)

This issue type is intended for a regular review of all Green Software Foundation meetup groups. We want to ensure we maintain an active ecosystem with events taking place in-person at least every 3 months. 

Where we have seen groups are inactive, for groups the GSF owns, the GSF may appoint new group organisers, either in addition to or replacing the existing organiser. Wherever possible, this is always in agreement with existing organisers. Please review the [Meetup Guide](https://grnsft.org/docs/meetupguide) for more details. 

Sponsored Groups (non-GSF controlled groups) may be removed from Meetup Pro in the case of a code of conduct issue, or if inactive for more than 6 months. Again, we will always strive to discuss this with organisers first.

### Where the group is active...
- [ ] Does the organiser feel they have all the help and support they need?
- [ ] Are the organisers part of the [_meetup-organizers_ Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/greensoftware.foundation/g/meetup-organizers/members)?
- [ ] Is there a roadmap of events?
- [ ] Have all events been catalogued in GitHub? Template for creating a new meetup event issue is [here](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/meetup/issues/new?assignees=&labels=event&projects=&template=new-event.md&title=YYYY+MM+DD+-+%5BMeetup+Group%5D+-+Event+Playbook).

### Where the group is inactive...
- [ ] Have we tried to contact the organiser?
- [ ] Have we emailed the existing membership to find a new organiser?
- [ ] Is the group sufficiently inactive to propose asking members to join GSF Global in place of a local group?
- [ ] Are there any other local "Green Software" type groups that could take over efforts or become a sponsored group?
