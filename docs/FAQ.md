# FAQ

### Do you need to be a GSF member to organize a meetup?

Anyone can become a meetup organizer, you don't need to be an employee of a GSF member organization.

### I'm interested in helping out at a meetup group?

If there is an event planned in the near future the best way to get involved is just to turn up to the event and introduce yourselves to the other organisers. Let them know you'd like to get more involved and they will talk to you about options.

If there are no events planned in the near future just message the meetup group in our dicussions forum. Find the right [meetup group thread in the forum](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/meetup/discussions/categories/meetup-groups) and introduce yourself, tag the other organizers in your message there GitHub handles should be in the first message in the thread.

### There is no meetup group near me, what should I do?

Consider starting your own meetup group, we have lots of material in our [Organizer Guide](./guide). We provide lots of support to you along your way and you can browse GitHub to see how our other Meetup organizers are running things.
