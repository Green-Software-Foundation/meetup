# Organizers Guide

Meetup **Members** build the base of the [GSF Meetup Network](https://www.meetup.com/pro/gsf/). 

They are organized in local **Groups** across the globe led by Meetup **Organizers**. Organizers play a key role in keeping the local Groups running. Their main role is to organize events and activities for the Members of their Group.

The main purpose of these guidelines is to provide the Organizers with the needed information to effectively run their Groups on a self-organized basis.
